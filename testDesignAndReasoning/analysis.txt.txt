1.	How would the interphase differentiate a user and a admin
2.	How is authentication of the users validated 

Answer 2
I would like to have a simple single sign on interphase for all the user types. Users can login with valid credentials and post login we will have an entry screen based upon the type of user that have logged in and permissions assigned to them.
If a admin have logged in present him with a simple UI to see the list of existing users and next to every user present then options to either manage or delete.
Is itâ€™s not an admin user present him with the options or features that he is allowed to.
